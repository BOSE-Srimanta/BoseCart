<br>I made some extra few features on this website. those are,- 
<li>Contact page, in where a form will display for users only. where they give feedback or send their valuable thought or problem to the admin. those data will save in my MongoDB cluster. where i checked the data.</li>
<li>About Us page, its a static page, where user scroll on to the page, the data will save in my database. basically, I designed this static page for <b>Advertising of my Website.</b> Where I put some read-only content and put a link of my LinkedIn profile, where they can visit freely.</li>
<li>/Seller admin page, I created on the purposes of adding product on bestseller page. Where Customer visit from their neediness and they also buy those product of best selling products option. Admin like seller will set those products from assets folder. which are already created in our client site.</li>
<li>Categories, I created on the purpose of, Where I can maintain the micro-segmentation of varities of products. where the variety section help to users to choose their likelihood products.</li>
<li>Online Payment Gateway, For that, I used Stripe API for users, where they can buys product from online payment method. Where I push API Keys and WebHooks for Automated functionalised VISA or Any other card numbers.</li>
<li>For Password Secret Key, Hashed Password, I used bycryptjs function. Where it hased the original password. so noone can see actual password of users.</li>
<li>I maintained ZTA(Zero Trust Architecture) sytem by using Micro-Segmentation method on my Pages. Where hacking threats are minimum.</li>
<li>Vercel.Domain, for that I used to handle deplyoment section of my Vercel Account. Where I can deploy my site for maximum days for future purposes.</li>
<li>JWT(JSONWEBTOKEN), I used this to Varify User login for Future purpose. Where Same User no need to login from different ID's. Same ID will save on my Database Server.</li>
