# Hey! Myself Srimanta Bose.
devloper of this Website named, <b> BoseCart </b>
Here is the online deployment link of this site -> https://bose-cart.vercel.app/
I made some extra few features on this website. those are,- 
Contact page, in where a form will display for users only. where they give feedback or send their valuable thought or problem to the admin. those data will save in my MongoDB cluster. where i checked the data. 
About Us page, its a static page, where user scroll on to the page, the data will save in my database. basically, i designed this static page for advertising of my Website. where i put some read-only content and put a link of my LinkedIn profile, where they visit freely.
/Seller admin page, I created on the purposes of adding product on bestseller page. where customer visit for their needness and they also buy those product of best selling products option. Admin like seller will set their product from assets folder. which are already created in our client site.
